# Student-Management-System
## Overview

Welcome to the Student Management System project! This console-based application provides a comprehensive platform to manage student information efficiently. This project is an excellent opportunity to practice and master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Features

### Add New Students
Learn how to create a system that allows you to add new students to the database. Each student will have essential information such as name and ID.

### Generate Unique Student ID
Implement a feature that generates a unique 5-digit student ID for each new student. This ensures that every student can be uniquely identified within the system.

### Enroll in Courses
Develop functionality to enroll students in various courses offered. This includes selecting courses and ensuring that students are registered correctly.

### View Balance
Create a system where students can view their current tuition balance. This helps in maintaining transparency and allows students to keep track of their financial obligations.

### Pay Tuition Fees
Enable students to pay their tuition fees through the system. Implement logic to update their balance accordingly and ensure that the payment process is smooth and accurate.

### Show Student Status
Implement a comprehensive status display for each student. This feature will show all the relevant details, including:
- **Name**
- **Student ID**
- **Enrolled Courses**
- **Tuition Balance**

## Learning Objectives

This project aims to teach and reinforce several key programming concepts:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Understand and apply OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- **Data Management:** Learn how to manage and manipulate student data efficiently.
- **User Interaction:** Develop a user-friendly console interface for interacting with the system.
- **Problem Solving:** Enhance problem-solving skills by implementing and testing various features and functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
